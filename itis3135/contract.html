    <h2>Course Contract</h2>
    <p><em>
        I, Wes Packham, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my FALL 2025, ITIS-3135, Web Development course with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork or that I wish to keep private. I understand that my work counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. I understand that it is possible to find examples online or view classmatesâ€™ code, but I will only use these resources to learn and will not copy code except where I give proper credit (e.g., external libraries).<br><br>
        Signed: Wes Packham, 08/31/2025

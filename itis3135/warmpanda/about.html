    <h3>Our founding story</h3>
    <p>We were founded when our founder had the idea of founding us. He found that he was finding many unused clothes.
        Finding many unused and ripped clothes led to our founder laying the foundation for founding the company.</p>
    <h3>Our expertise</h3>
    <p>Our team is full of worldclass seamtresses, sewers, designers, and one person who climbed Mount Everest twice.
        This means that we are really good at doing our job.</p>
    <h3>Our services</h3>
    <p>We can make custom clothes, we can repair old clothes, we can transform clothes into something new.
        It is very similar to our mascot, the warm panda, because our clothes will make you look hot,
        even when you're sleeping and lying around and snacking on bamboo.</p>
